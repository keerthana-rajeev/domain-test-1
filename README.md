# Domain Test

Domain test is an easy-to-use web application intended to allow students of an organization to appear for examinations. The start time and end time of examinations can be controlled manually, and so can the questions or diagrams to be displayed alongside. Answers are accessed only via the admin-login portal.

## Starting off

Use the package manager npm to start the application.

```bash
npm install
nodemon index.js
```
